CHEAP YELLOW DISPLAY PROJECT ESP32-2432S028

Cheap Yellow Display hacked to be Li Powered with power button, charger, enlarged case and minimal soldering. Most of my projects start out rough and then I refine compromises.

Li Charger Board from Amazon with Micro USB charging going through a micro usb breakout board I had.
Cool lock switch (power button) that I had laying around.
2 pin cables to remove my bad solder jobs
1100 mah Li Battery from Amazon
Cheap Yellow Display - Resistive Toch for now
3d Printed case that I modified for the button, battery and board while keeping the original size aspects. Its just a bit deeper. USB ports on the end are opened up to allow greater cable use.
Marauder loaded via web flash tool - I will modify this to use the capacitive display as soon as I test it on my bench.
