<p>CHEAP YELLOW DISPLAY PROJECT ESP32-2432S028</p>
<p>Cheap Yellow Display hacked to be Li Powered with power button, charger, enlarged case and minimal soldering. Most of my projects start out rough and then I refine compromises.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Li Charger Board from Amazon with Micro USB charging going through a micro usb breakout board I had.</li>
    <li>Cool lock switch (power button) that I had laying around.</li>
    <li>2 pin cables to remove my bad solder jobs</li>
    <li>1100 mah Li Battery from Amazon</li>
    <li>Cheap Yellow Display - Resistive Toch for now</li>
    <li>3d Printed case that I modified for the button, battery and board while keeping the original size aspects. Its just a bit deeper. USB ports on the end are opened up to allow greater cable use.</li>
    <li>Marauder loaded via web flash tool - I will modify this to use the capacitive display as soon as I test it on my bench.</li>
</ul>
