Arduino boards and projects

List of projects I have modified to be more useful for my needs. From board modifications, addons, to 3d printed parts such as housing and other components. I find projectes out there and build them, modify them for more specific purposes such as Li Battery or bigger screen or other featuers that take a little time but are fun to incorporate into builds.
