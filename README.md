Arduino boards and projects

List of projects I have modified to be more useful for my needs. From board modifications, addons, to 3d printed parts such as housing and other components. I find projectes out there and build them, modify them for more specific purposes such as Li Battery or bigger screen or other featuers that take a little time but are fun to incorporate into builds.

Note: Some of my builds are for whitehat projects to test out attack vectors but are not intended as a howto hack guide. I dont think its a good idea to interfere with the communication of devices that you do not own. Be warned.

Projects:

Cheap Yellow Display hacked to be Li Powered with power button, charger, enlarged case and minimal soldering. Most of my projects start out rough and then I refine compromises.
  - Solar / Li Charger Board from Amazon with Micro USB charging going through what would be the solar input.
  - Cool lock switch (power button) that I had laying around.
  - 2 pin cables to remove my bad solder jobs
  - 1100 mah Li Battery from Amazon
  - Cheap Yellow Display - Resistive Toch for now
  - 3d Printed case that I modified for the button, battery and board while keeping the original size aspects. Its just a bit deeper. USB ports on the end are opened up to allow greater cable use.
  - Marauder loaded via web flash tool - I will modify this to use the capacitive display as soon as I test it on my bench.

Stram Deck / Open Source alternative
  - Toying with this idea to create a macro pad on my desk to jump to Notepad++, SQL, and Arduino with the toch on a screen.

Pi Pico with Lora / Meshtastic and MQtt- Check out my other REPO for more meshtastic projects. This started my addiction to stream line the production of devices and learn more about I2C and other protocols for PI / Arduino stuff.
